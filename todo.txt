#- done

#- Integrate analog input from timer into Interface
#- Change settings and re-word so analog input output + counter is clearer
#- Add extra channels to GUI
#- Thread Interface
#- Modify datamanager to store AI
# Modify filemanager to store AI
#- Add second graph to plot ai
- Add kill interface
- Create error reporting back to gui
#- Go from self.notebook.getOpenTab().session to
#  self.notebook.getOpenSession() as gui is never really accessed
#- Redo Thread -> process
#- Remove any loading of previous data (pointless)
- Fix range e.g 0-5 currently does 0-4.9
- (Somehow) fix weird averaging on graphing

File capture:
Say I have a capture called 'mycapture', then we generate
3 separate files:
mycapture.raw.ai.csv
mycapture.raw.counts.csv
mycapture.integrated.csv


Each file should store a settings header so settings can
be retrieved at any one time. Opening any of the files,
the program should "intelligently" look for the others
and prompt the user if either of the 'raw' ones are missing
(integrated can always be generated from raw).

Integrated format (but in csv, with header):

Volts	   Count	AI Volt
0	   3		2.5
0.1	   1		3.1
...	   ...		...

Raw format (again csv, with header):

A scan * intervalsPerScan dimension array
where position [i][j] corresponds to the
counts / ai volts on the ith scan in the
jth interval (ie voltage).
