{"name":"Mallard","tagline":"Data Acquisition for the CRIS experiment at ISOLDE","body":"### Mallard for CRIS at [ISOLDE](http://isolde.web.cern.ch/)\r\nMallard (Multi-Analog LossLess Acquisition of Resonance Data) is data acquisition software for the Collinear Resonant Ionization Spectroscopy experiment at CERN.\r\n\r\n### Contents\r\n- [Installation](#installation)\r\n- [Usage](#usage)\r\n- [Development](#development)\r\n- [Authors](#authors)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nMallard is written in python and so requires a python distribution such as [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/).\r\n#### Dependences\r\nMallard has the following dependencies:\r\n* [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/)\r\n* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) (on windows we use [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/) )\r\n* [PyDAQmx](http://pythonhosted.org/PyDAQmx/)\r\n\r\nMallard also uses [NI-DAQmx](http://www.ni.com/dataacquisition/nidaqmx.htm) from National Instruments to interface the **USB-6211** card.\r\n\r\n#### Setup\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nThe mallard package uses several sub-packages:\r\n* `mallard.core` - base functionality for the package including data and file handling, as well as managing a general capture session including settings\r\n* `mallard.daq` - interfaces to the USB-6211 card. If the card needs changed in future then only this module needs rewritten\r\n* `mallard.gui` - provides the user interface using wxPython\r\n* `mallard.test` - all the small scripts created along the way, in case they come in handy at a later point\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nOriginally written by Kieran Campbell (@kieranrcampbell) as part of the CERN summer student program.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
